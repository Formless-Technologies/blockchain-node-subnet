# **Blockchain Node Subnet**

<div align="left">

## Bittensor

Bittensor is a blockchain protocol that hosts multiple self-contained incentive mechanisms called subnets. Subnets are playing fields in which:

- Subnet **Miners** do some form of computational work, and
- Subnet **Validators** produce consensus about the quality of the work in order for the protocol to reward the Miners.

## Blockchain Node Subnet Information

With that in mind, this subnet aims to reward **Miners** for running and providing access to blockchain nodes (a piece of software that connects to a blockchain network and verifies and transmits transactions).

**Validators** ensure that **Miners** have ongoing, up-to-date access to a blockchain node by frequently sending challenges to the Miners about the history of the network, as well as sending them transactions and then ensuring that the Miner has posted the transaction to the network.
